# Challenges:

### Next.js
- Having a lot of paradigms to build a component (server-side or client-side).
- Many packages didnâ€™t have a server-side implementation, so I had to create a lot of workarounds.

### Auth0
- The Next.js SDK has very cumbersome TypeScript interfaces and types, so aligning with them was a hassle.
- Difficult integration with Amplify and lack of resources.
- The SDK underwent many changes, leading to outdated or unanswered solutions.

### TinyMCE
- It's easy to get the editor working, but making adjustments or implementing workarounds was a headache.
- Very poor TypeScript support.

### Build Process
- Encountered many strange errors and warnings during the build process, even though the code worked fine in dev mode.

### Amplify
- Some features, like server actions, were not supported, so we had to either avoid using those features or implement workarounds.
